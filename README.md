# Schema Tests

* Install `YAML Support by RedHat` VScode extension

* You define your schema and file glob in one of the `settings.json` files VSCode provisions.  I chose to use the local project file for portability.  More info on configuring plugin can be found on the [extension project page](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml)

* You can reference [json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org/example2.html) for an example of additional schemas
